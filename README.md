# power_perf_dgemm

This is a project that uses ESMI to change PPT and run DGEMM to observe the impact of power cap to clock frequency and performance score.
Output file is "result_<timestamp>.txt. Data can be manually put into excel to plot a graph, or ask ChatGPT's help to do so.


Pre-requisite
1. Put this script into the DGEMM directory of PPOG
2. Install ESMI, HSMP and have amd_energy/msr-safe. ESMI needs to be fully operational
3. Install AVT
